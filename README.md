# JavaScriptmas2022-challenge

## Overview

This project includes daily small challenges, organized by [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) as JavaScriptmas2022ðŸŽ„ from December 1-24.

At the end of these competition, prize were awarded by drawing on the grand final day. Since I was not on my lucky day, I did not win the lottery. But by the end of the 24th day I realized that I had already gained a few things:

1. I have increased my practice with the Javascript methods I use for the content of the competition.
2. I made code review to another person every day and increased my code reading skills.
3. I received and gave feedback, so I had the opportunity to get to know the subjects I was good at and lacking.
